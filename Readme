* This is an example code for the algorithm described in

Ruiqi Jiang, Hang Zhou, Weiming Zhang, and Nenghai Yu.
"Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted 3D Mesh Models", TMM 2017.

* To run the example code: 
1. Download "toolbox_graph", a public toolbox for 3D mesh processing;
2. Put source 3D meshes in the "data/source" directory;
3. Start from main.m.
